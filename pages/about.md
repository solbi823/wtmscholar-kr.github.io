# About

We are Korean scholars of [Women Techmakers Scholars Program 2019](https://www.womentechmakers.com/scholars).<br/>
We have built this website to share our vision and thoughts over various topics.

This website is autonomously maintained by Korean scholars of 2019. You will notice that there are many more features to implement, and we hope to implement them as soon as possible. If you have any suggestions for new features or ideas, feel free to leave comments on [github issue](https://github.com/womentechkorea/womentechkorea.github.io/issues).

You can follow us on [github](https://github.com/womentechkorea).

"*Through the Women Techmakers Scholars Program - formerly the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship Program - Google is furthering Dr. Anita Borgâ€™s vision of creating gender equality in the tech industry by encouraging women to excel as active participants and leaders in the field.*"<br/>
